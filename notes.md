* App Side Joins: replace post with get, and two types in one index is no more possible
* Exercise setup, add step-by-step for putty users. Missing instructions for import key and ubuntu username
* List consideration es vs. a db \(maybe in the extras\)
* Mapping: broken formatting code snippet, expand on multi-field with id and id.keyword
