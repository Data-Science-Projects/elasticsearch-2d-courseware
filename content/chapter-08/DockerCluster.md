# Docker Cluster

* In our exercise, we have used single docker host
* For production, we rather use multiple hosts to run our containers
* [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) provides orchestration up-to 1,000 nodes and 30,000 containers
* Docker Swarm is no more a forerunner for container orchestration
* Kubernetes platform for on-premises and on-the-cloud hosting is the preferred option for container orchestration

* The preferred approach for Kubernetes deployment is helm charts with an official collection of helm chart for [elastic products](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts) 
* In addition to the self-hosted version of docker, there are Aws Kubernetes Service, Google Container Engine, Docker Cloud, and Azure Container Service
