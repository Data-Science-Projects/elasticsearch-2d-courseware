# Introduction to Docker #

* Eliminates 'works on my machine' by escaping matrix dependencies
* Run applications side-by-side with predictable and portable deployments
* Achieves higher compute density - unlike VMs only libraries and settings are required
* Maintain immutable and tamper-proof images
* Promotes a higher density deployment model compared to Virtual Machines
