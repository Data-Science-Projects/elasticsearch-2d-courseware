# Hardware

* ElasticSearch has been built to scale out on commodity hardware not to scale up on monster hardware
* SAN trouble: all nodes will read and write using the same hardware and a single point of failure
* SSD vs. HDD: same as with many I/O intensive systems: SSD is faster, not safer
* Have not heard of specialty ElasticSearch hardware yet
* There is no specific hardware mentioned in ElasticSearch documentation
