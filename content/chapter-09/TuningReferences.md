# Tuning References #

* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/guidance-elasticsearch-tuning-data-aggregation-and-query-performance/#performance-results---disk-type) specific, but with lots of useful tips
* [Loggly.com performance lessons](https://www.loggly.com/blog/nine-tips-configuring-elasticsearch-for-high-performance/) - a bit logs specific, but volumes and throughput perspective is very valuable
* [Codecentric](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2014/05/elasticsearch-indexing-performance-cheatsheet/) - a bit dated, many points are still relevant
* [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/10-elasticsearch-metrics-to-watch) article - very systematic and detailed.
