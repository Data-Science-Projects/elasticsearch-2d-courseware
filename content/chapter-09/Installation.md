# Installation #

* Deb/Rpm repositories seems like a logical choice
* 'yum/apt-get upgrade' will update version of Elastic products
* Great choice, when you don't have plug-ins installed
* Plug-ins have a version specified in their configuration
* After 'apt-get upgrade' you may end-up with plug-ins disabled, including security plugin-ins
