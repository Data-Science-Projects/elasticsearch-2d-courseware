# Alerting #

* ElasticStack offers license for X-Pack that includes [Alerts](https://www.elastic.co/products/x-pack/alerting)
* [ElastAlert](http://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elastalert.html) is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, and more
* Aws CloudWatch comes with alerts for EC2 instances and for PaaS/DaaS services
* [Cabot](http://cabotapp.com/use/services.html) - monitor and alert
* We can build our own thanks to REST Api, is it a worthy initiative?
* Automated remediation instead of alerting, probably is the future
