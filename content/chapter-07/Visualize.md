# Visualize

* A framework to present your data in an aggregated or graphical fashion
* Data table - aggregated data presentation, not a mechanism for a data dump
* There is no built-in mechanism to dump data of a search
* Third-party plugin for data import/export: [knapsack](https://github.com/jprante/elasticsearch-knapsack) cannot export more data than rows shown on the page
* Data Table - by default presents a count of the documents found by search
* Can use new or previously saved Discover search
* Two components: metrics and aggregation
* Metrics: a loose equivalent of measures in a fact table from BI \(Business Intelligence\) world
* Aggregation: a loose equivalent of dimension in OLAP \(online analytical processing\) world
