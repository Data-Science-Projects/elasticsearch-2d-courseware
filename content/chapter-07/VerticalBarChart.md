# Vertical Bar Chart

* Commonly used to present high-density data such as logs and a network traffic
* The description on the Kiabana user interface used to suggest: "if you are not sure which chart you need, you could do worse than to start here"
* I wish it was listed as the first option on the Visualize tab
* Metrics are similar to Data Table and Metric visualization: numeric value to present
* Buckets are similar to aggregation in Data Table: a way to partition the data
* Two options to consider: Split Bars or Split Chart
* Not extremely intuitive user interface and/or configuration options
* Support selecting a range on the chart with a mouse
