# Sql Exercise

* Login into your ElasticSearch sandbox
* Double-check elasticsearch service is running 
* Confirm there are some records to search on:
  ```
  curl 'localhost:9200/collisions/_search?pretty=true'
  ```
* Use the rest api or sql-cli
* Repeat the filter and search choices experimented with in the last two labs using sql syntax
* Do you notice any differences in behaviour?
